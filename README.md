# Hand-Gesture-Emulating-Robotic-Arm
Objective of this project was to design an ultra low cost Robotic Manipulator which can emulate
the userâ€™s hand movements according to its 2 Degrees of Freedom and a gripping mechanism
wirelessly using ADXL335 accelerometer and Flex Sensor processed by Arduino Uno.

Two Arduino Uno were used, one for Transmitter section and another for Reciever section. The complete cost of production was less than Rs. 10000. The arm chassis was manufactured indigenously.
